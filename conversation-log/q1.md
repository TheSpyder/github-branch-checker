Write a script that will search local git branches and match JIRA ticket numbers out of them (for example TINY-1234).

For each match found, it needs to search a JIRA instance at https://ephocks.atlassian.net for the ticket number. Each ticket should be printed in a list, tab-delineated with the ticket status and a link to open the ticket.

------------------------------------------

<think>The user wants me to create a script that:
1. Searches local git branches
2. Extracts JIRA ticket numbers (e.g., TINY-1234) from these branches
3. Searches a JIRA instance at https://ephocks.atlassian.net for each ticket number
4. Prints a list of these tickets with tab-delimited format showing the ticket status and a link to open the ticket

To accomplish this, I'll need to:
1. Create a script that can list git branches and extract JIRA ticket numbers with regex
2. Query the JIRA API to get information about each ticket
3. Format and output the results as requested

Let's first check if there's any existing code in the workspace to understand the context better.</think>I'll create a script that scans git branches for JIRA ticket numbers, fetches their status from JIRA, and displays them in a tab-delimited format. Let's check what we're working with first.

Ran tool
It looks like we're starting with an empty workspace. I'll create a Python script to accomplish this task since Python has good libraries for both Git and JIRA API interaction.

First, I'll create a script that:
1. Uses the `git` command to list branches
2. Parses JIRA ticket numbers using regex
3. Queries the JIRA API for each ticket's status
4. Outputs the results in the requested format

```python:jira_branch_checker.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess
import re
import sys
import requests
from getpass import getpass
import argparse
from urllib.parse import quote

def get_git_branches():
    """Get all local git branches"""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ['git', 'branch'],
            check=True,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True
        )
        branches = [branch.strip() for branch in result.stdout.split('\n') if branch]
        # Remove the asterisk from the current branch
        branches = [branch[2:] if branch.startswith('* ') else branch for branch in branches]
        return branches
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error getting git branches: {e.stderr}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

def extract_jira_tickets(branches):
    """Extract JIRA ticket numbers from branch names"""
    # Looking for patterns like PROJ-123 or ABC-456
    ticket_pattern = re.compile(r'([A-Z]+-\d+)')
    tickets = set()
    
    for branch in branches:
        matches = ticket_pattern.findall(branch)
        tickets.update(matches)
    
    return sorted(list(tickets))

def get_jira_status(ticket, jira_base_url, auth=None):
    """Get the status of a JIRA ticket"""
    url = f"{jira_base_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{quote(ticket)}"
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, auth=auth)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            status = data.get('fields', {}).get('status', {}).get('name', 'Unknown')
            return status
        else:
            return f"Error: {response.status_code}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Check JIRA tickets in git branches')
    parser.add_argument('--username', help='JIRA username/email')
    parser.add_argument('--jira-url', default='https://ephocks.atlassian.net', help='JIRA base URL')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    # Get git branches
    branches = get_git_branches()
    
    # Extract JIRA tickets
    tickets = extract_jira_tickets(branches)
    
    if not tickets:
        print("No JIRA tickets found in branch names.")
        return
    
    # Authenticate with JIRA if credentials provided
    auth = None
    if args.username:
        password = getpass("Enter your JIRA API token: ")
        auth = (args.username, password)
    
    # Print header
    print(f"Ticket\tStatus\tLink")
    
    # Check each ticket
    for ticket in tickets:
        status = get_jira_status(ticket, args.jira_url, auth)
        link = f"{args.jira_url}/browse/{ticket}"
        print(f"{ticket}\t{status}\t{link}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Now let's create a README file that explains how to use the script:

```markdown:README.md
# JIRA Branch Checker

This script scans local git branches for JIRA ticket numbers (like TINY-1234), then checks the status of each ticket on JIRA and produces a tab-delimited report.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library: `pip install requests`
- Git installed and in PATH
- Access to a JIRA instance

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script
2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x jira_branch_checker.py
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

Run the script in a Git repository:

```
./jira_branch_checker.py
```

By default, the script will:
1. Get all local Git branches
2. Extract JIRA ticket numbers using regex pattern matching (e.g., PROJ-123)
3. Attempt to fetch the status of each ticket from JIRA
4. Print a tab-delimited report with ticket numbers, statuses, and links

### Authentication

JIRA's REST API requires authentication. You can provide your JIRA credentials with:

```
./jira_branch_checker.py --username your.email@example.com
```

You will be prompted for your JIRA API token (not your password). You can create an API token in your Atlassian account settings.

### JIRA Instance URL

By default, the script uses `https://ephocks.atlassian.net` as the JIRA instance. You can specify a different URL:

```
./jira_branch_checker.py --jira-url https://your-instance.atlassian.net
```

## Output Format

The script outputs a tab-delimited report with these columns:
- Ticket ID (e.g., PROJ-123)
- Status (e.g., "In Progress", "Done")
- Link to the ticket

Example output:
```
Ticket  Status  Link
PROJ-123    In Progress https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
PROJ-456    Done        https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-456
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Error getting git branches**: Make sure you're running the script in a Git repository
- **Authentication errors**: Verify your JIRA username and API token
- **No tickets found**: The script might not recognize your ticket number format. Check the regex pattern in the code.
```
Now let's create a `requirements.txt` file to make it easier to install dependencies:

```plain text:requirements.txt
requests>=2.25.0
```
I've created a complete solution to search for JIRA ticket numbers in git branches and check their status. Here's what I've built:

1. **jira_branch_checker.py** - The main Python script that:
   - Gets all local git branches using `git branch` command
   - Extracts JIRA ticket numbers using regex (pattern like "TINY-1234")
   - Queries the JIRA API at https://ephocks.atlassian.net for each ticket's status
   - Outputs a tab-delimited report with ticket numbers, statuses, and links

2. **README.md** - Documentation explaining:
   - How to install and use the script
   - Authentication options
   - Usage examples
   - Expected output format

3. **requirements.txt** - A simple file listing the single dependency (requests)

### How to use the script:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x jira_branch_checker.py
   ```

2. Install the requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script in a git repository:
   ```
   ./jira_branch_checker.py
   ```

4. For authenticated access (recommended as JIRA's API usually requires it):
   ```
   ./jira_branch_checker.py --username your.email@example.com
   ```
   You'll be prompted for your JIRA API token.

The script will output a tab-delimited report with columns for the ticket number, status, and link.

Is there anything specific about the script you'd like me to explain or modify?
