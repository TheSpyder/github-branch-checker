The script works, but it only checks local branches. Please include the remote branches as well.

------

<think>The user wants the script to also check remote branches, not just local ones. Currently, in the `get_git_branches()` function, we're only using `git branch` which by default only shows local branches. 

To include remote branches, we need to:

1. Modify the `get_git_branches()` function to also fetch remote branches using `git branch -r` or possibly use `git branch -a` to get both local and remote branches.
2. We'll need to strip the "remote/" prefix from branch names to properly extract ticket numbers.

Let's update the function.</think>I'll modify the script to include both local and remote branches in the search. This will give you more comprehensive results by checking all branches in the repository.

Now, let's update the README to reflect this change:

```markdown:README.md
# JIRA Branch Checker

This script scans both local and remote git branches for JIRA ticket numbers (like TINY-1234), then checks the status of each ticket on JIRA and produces a tab-delimited report.

## Requirements

// ... existing code ...
```

```markdown:README.md
# JIRA Branch Checker

This script scans both local and remote git branches for JIRA ticket numbers (like TINY-1234), then checks the status of each ticket on JIRA and produces a tab-delimited report.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library: `pip install requests`
- Git installed and in PATH
- Access to a JIRA instance

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script
2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x jira_branch_checker.py
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

Run the script in a Git repository:

```
./jira_branch_checker.py
```

By default, the script will:
1. Get all local and remote Git branches
2. Extract JIRA ticket numbers using regex pattern matching (e.g., PROJ-123)
3. Prompt for JIRA authentication (required for the default server)
4. Print a tab-delimited report with ticket numbers, statuses, and links

// ... existing code ...
```
I've updated the script to include both local and remote branches in its search. Here are the changes made:

### 1. Enhanced the `get_git_branches()` function:

- Now it collects branches from two separate Git commands:
  - `git branch` to get local branches (as before)
  - `git branch -r` to get remote branches

- For remote branches, the function:
  - Filters out HEAD references (containing "->")
  - Keeps the remote prefix (like "origin/feature-JIRA-123") since these can still contain valid JIRA ticket numbers

- Both sets of branches are combined into a single list that's returned for processing

### 2. Updated documentation:

- The README now clearly states that the script scans "both local and remote Git branches"
- Updated the default behavior description to mention that it gets "all local and remote Git branches"

This enhancement will give you more comprehensive results, as it now checks all branches in your repository, not just the local ones. The JIRA ticket extraction, status checking, and reporting functionality remain unchanged.

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust or improve in the script?
