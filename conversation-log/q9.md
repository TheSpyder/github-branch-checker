Some of these tickets are closed with a resolution. For those tickets, print both status and resolution separated by a colon

------

<think>The user wants to enhance the output to show the resolution for tickets that have been closed. This means we need to:

1. Modify the `get_jira_status` function to also retrieve the resolution information when available
2. Update the output format to display both status and resolution (separated by a colon) when resolution exists

Let's modify the script to add this feature.</think>I'll modify the script to display both status and resolution (separated by a colon) for tickets that have a resolution. This will provide more detailed information for closed tickets.

```python:jira_branch_checker.py
// ... existing code ...

def get_jira_status(ticket, jira_base_url, auth=None):
    """Get the status and resolution of a JIRA ticket"""
    url = f"{jira_base_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{quote(ticket)}"
    
    if auth is None and jira_base_url == "https://ephocks.atlassian.net":
        print("Error: Authentication is required for the default JIRA server", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, auth=auth)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            status = data.get('fields', {}).get('status', {}).get('name', 'Unknown')
            
            # Check if there's a resolution
            resolution = data.get('fields', {}).get('resolution', {})
            resolution_name = resolution.get('name') if resolution else None
            
            # If we have a resolution, include it with the status
            if resolution_name:
                return f"{status}: {resolution_name}"
            else:
                return status
        elif response.status_code == 401:
            print(f"Error: Authentication failed for {jira_base_url}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(1)
        else:
            return f"Error: {response.status_code}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

// ... existing code ...
```
Now let's update the README to mention this new feature:

```markdown:README.md
# JIRA Branch Checker

This script scans both local and remote git branches for JIRA ticket numbers (like TINY-1234), then checks the status of each ticket on JIRA and produces a formatted report.

// ... existing code ...

## Output Format

The script provides two output formats:

### Table Format (Default)

By default, the script outputs a nicely formatted table with proper column widths:

```
Ticket      Status                 Link
--------    --------------------   ----
PROJ-123    In Progress            https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
PROJ-456    Closed: Fixed          https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-456
PROJ-789    Done                   https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-789
```

For tickets that have been resolved, the status will include both the status and resolution separated by a colon (e.g., "Closed: Fixed").

### CSV Format

// ... existing code ...

### Additional Features

- **Progress Indicator**: Shows real-time progress while checking ticket statuses
- **Token Storage**: Securely saves your authentication token (with permission)
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Choose between human-readable tables or machine-readable CSV
- **Graceful Interruption**: Safely cancel the script with Ctrl+C without stack traces
- **Flexible Sorting**: Sort results by ticket status or ticket number
- **Resolution Information**: Displays resolution details for closed tickets (e.g., "Closed: Fixed")
```
I've enhanced the script to show resolution information for tickets that have it. Here's what I changed:

### 1. Improved the JIRA Data Retrieval

I modified the `get_jira_status` function to:

- Retrieve both status and resolution information from the JIRA API
- Check if a resolution exists for the ticket
- Return a combined string in the format "Status: Resolution" when a resolution is present
- Keep returning just the status for tickets that don't have a resolution

### 2. Implementation Details

- The JIRA API returns resolution information in the `fields.resolution` field
- Resolution is typically present for tickets that have been closed or resolved in some way
- Common resolution values include "Fixed", "Won't Fix", "Duplicate", "Cannot Reproduce", etc.
- The combined format (e.g., "Closed: Fixed") provides more context about why a ticket was closed

### 3. Output Format

The status column in the output now:
- Shows regular status for tickets in progress (e.g., "In Progress", "To Do")
- Shows both status and resolution for resolved tickets (e.g., "Closed: Fixed", "Done: Completed")
- Maintains the same table and CSV formats, just with more detailed information

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated the example output in the README to show how resolution information appears
- Added an explanation of the "Status: Resolution" format
- Listed the new feature in the "Additional Features" section

This enhancement provides more valuable information at a glance, helping you understand not just that a ticket is closed, but also why it was closed (its resolution).
